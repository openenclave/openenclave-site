## Jekyll themed website for OpenEnclave

To get started on using Jekyll for a website hosted on Github pages, please see the [Github pages documentation.](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)

Once you have jekyll set up and this repo cloned, to preview locally, use the following command. 

```
bundle exec jekyll serve  --host=<IPADDRESS of m/c you are running from>
```

This gives you an URL that you can then paste in your browser.

Before previewing, change _config.yml so both baseurl and url are "".

This website uses theme slate.
